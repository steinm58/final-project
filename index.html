      <p>Welcome to my book blog! This is a space where I can share my favorite books and all my book reviews. There is a monthly reads page where I pick one book a month to do a more in depth review. This includes a chapter breakdown that has my thoughts on the chapters as I read them. Then there will be a final review posted on the review page. Along with all the other books I have finished that month.</p>
