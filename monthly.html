                <p>"Pip is about to head to college, but she is still haunted by the way her last investigation ended. She’s used to online death threats in the wake of her viral true-crime podcast, but she can’t help noticing an anonymous person who keeps asking her: Who will look for you when you’re the one who disappears?"</p>

        <div class="chapter-breakdown">
            <p class="chapter-number">chapter one</p>
            <div class="chapter">
                <p>This first chapter is a huge look into what Pip went through in the last book. She has a lot of trauma now and it is really sad. There is also a thing with Max going on because of the way she exposed him at the end of the last book with the audio clip she posted.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="chapter-number">chapter two</p>
            <div class="chapter">
                <p>This is when the meeting with Max and his lawyer happens. This chapter was a little crazy in my opinion because what Max and his lawyer were asking for was absurd. They wanted Pip to pay seven thousand to Max and then lie to her fans about the audio clip she posted. I have always liked Pips character but this chapter made me like her even more. She really stood her ground and she is ready to take Max to court and I know she definitely won't go down without a fight.</p>
